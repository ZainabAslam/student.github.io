                Like Muhammad,
            </h2> <h2 style="color:lightgreen;">there are many children and adults who wants to gain knowledge <br /> </h2>
            <h2 style="font-size:24px;">
                But do not have the right resources. Adults who wants to try again,
                but are discouraged and pressurized to give up on their dreams and focus on making money. <br /> Imagine if

                Muhammad didn't give up, he would not have any regrets, maybe all of the struggles he went through, could not be avoided <br />
                But at the very least, he would not be that hard for him, if he had his basic education. <br />

                The idea of this school is inspired by the story of Muhammad, so that no child is deprive of education<br />
                And no adult is discourage to pursue it.
