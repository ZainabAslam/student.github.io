          <h3>Tic Tac Toe</h3>
          <p>Tic Tac Toe is a common game. It is one of my advanced games, made it using javascript which was really fun to make. Its not like other tic tac toe games where you have to play two turns, I made it so you can play only one turn and the other turn is played by the bot.</p>
